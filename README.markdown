Smooth line UIView
====================

The goal of this project is to create a UIView that can generate smooth lines from touch input in a reasonably fast manner without moving to a more complex framework like OpenGL. 

*Update:* Completely re-written smooth line algorithm to use native CGContext quadratic curves. The result is much faster and smoother drawing. There's no more need for switching between agorithms.
